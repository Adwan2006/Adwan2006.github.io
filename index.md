## Favourite CPSC 120L labs

* lab 3- part 1

his part is my favorite because it gives clear, step-by-step instructions for completing the task, making it easy to follow. It encourages teamwork and helps build skills through debugging and testing. The explanation of BMR also connects the project to real-world applications, which makes it more meaningful.

* lab 7

The exercise mimics real-life parking rules, using time, day, and street regulations, making it practical and easy to relate to. It connects programming to everyday situations, showing how your skills can solve real-world problems.

* lab 10

This section is my favorite because it demonstrates how to structure and organize data efficiently using two-dimensional vectors, enabling a clear and intuitive way to represent California's county population data.
